==Water Tracking App
I created this so I could track how much water I drink throughout the day.  This is about as simple as it gets.  Created mostly for my own use, but feel free to play around if you're interested.

==Installing
I'm using this on heroku without any issues.  Make sure you use the bamboo stack because it's written in rails 3.x
